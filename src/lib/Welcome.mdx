# 🪿 React Fidget Spinner

Turn your react component into a fun clickable spinning widget.

Click Me ⬇️

<Primary  />


## Quickstart

```bash
npm i react-fidget-spinner
```

```jsx
import {FidgetSpinner} from "react-fidget-spinner"

const MyFidgetSpinner = () => {

    return (
        <FidgetSpinner>
            <MyComponent> <-- This now spins when you click it
        </FidgetSpinner>
    )
}
```

## Using These Docs

Each exported component has a docs page and a primary example.

- The docs page will give an overview of the component and its props.
- The primary example acts as a fullscreen interactive playground.

The config for these components are often stored in objects, which doesn't work so well with storybook.
The arguments for the primary example are also the default config for that component.


## Features

- 🎡 Physics-based flywheel spinner animation and interaction
- ✨ Spark Particles
- 🫧 Bubble Particles
- 💥 Click Animation
- 🦣 Scaling Animation
- 🏎️ Velocity Breakpoints - Change your configuration based on the velocity of the spinner.
- 🎨 Highly customisable animations with full defaults to get you started
- 🔫 Callback triggers for all key events


## Design Paradigms

- Provide solid defaults but allow full customisation
- Animations should be as separate as possible (They might be useful on their own)
- Don't run animation code unless necessary
- Be serious about being silly
- Interactions should be fun and satisfying
- The goal is to allow people to sprinkle a bit of "fun" onto their existing react components _quickly_ - because fun isn't often prioritised.
- Design interactions using real life physics where possible
